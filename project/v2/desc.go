package main

/*
Update the app to store books and authors as per the following struct

type Book struct {
	ID int
	Name string
	AuthorID string
}

type Author struct {
	Name string
	ID int
}

Points:
1. Use in memory data structures like maps and slices to store the data.
2. The API endpoints should work using the in memory data structures.
3. There should not be any duplicate entry, the name should be the primary key for book and author both.
4. ID should be generated as an auto increment field.
